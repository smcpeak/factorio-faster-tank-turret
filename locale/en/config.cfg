faster-tank-turret-speed-multiplier=Turret traverse speed multiplier

[mod-setting-description]
faster-tank-turret-speed-multiplier=Set the traverse speed to this times the base game speed.  Must be in [0.1, 100].  The default value of 10 practically removes the firing delay, while still giving the visual impression of rotation.
